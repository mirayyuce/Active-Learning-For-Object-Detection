# Active-Learning-For-Object-Detection
Active Learning For Object Detection 

Computes informativeness of a single object detection using MC Dropout and DBSCAN. 
After computing the modelâ€™s uncertainty per detection, it aggregates the individual 
uncertainty values in two different ways. The first metric selects the images with 
crowded scenes, while the other is neutral to the number of detections in an image. 
Selection strategy: maximizing uncertainty.
Dataset: KITTI

1. Create tfrecords: /object_detection/dataset_tools/
   prepare_kitti_splits.py
   create_kitti_tfrecord_init_and_test.py
   create_kitti_tfrecord_random.py

2. Train & evaluate: /object_detection/legacy/train.py and  /object_detection/legacy/eval.py

3. Config file: /object_detection/faster_rcnn_resnet101_kitti.config In this file 'use_dropout: true'
   and 'dropout_keep_probability: 0.5'

4. Export the trained graph: /object_detection/export_inference_graph.py. A flag --mc_dropout must be True. 
   With this flag the graph will keep the dropout layers for inference

5. Compute uncertainties: /object_detection/compute_image_uncertainties.py. 

6. Create tfrecords for the most informative images with /object_detection/dataset_tools/create_kitti_tfrecord_uncertainty.py
